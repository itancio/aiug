# Enhance Model Performance with OpenAIâ€™s Fine-Tuning API

## Summary

Struggling with prompt-engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without seeing the desired performance? In this workshop, you will gain insight into when you should explore fine-tuning options and learn how to design and execute OpenAI fine-tuning jobs using a custom dataset.

## Key Functionality

The `fine_tuning.ipynb` notebook is a guide designed to walk you through the fine-tuning process with OpenAI's API using a custom dataset. Here's what it covers:

- **Dataset Preparation**: Instructions on how to prepare your dataset for fine-tuning, including formatting guidelines and best practices for text data.

- **Fine-Tuning Configuration**: Details on how to configure your fine-tuning job, including selecting the right model, setting up hyperparameters, and understanding the impact of each setting on your model's performance.

- **Executing Fine-Tuning Jobs**: Step-by-step guidance on how to submit your fine-tuning job to OpenAI's API, monitor its progress, and retrieve the trained model.

- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating the performance of your fine-tuned model, including metrics to consider and how to interpret them.

- **Integration and Deployment**: Tips on how to integrate your fine-tuned model into applications and deploy it for real-world use.
